# PHMSA_Sraper
This code pulls a specific utilitie's data from a folder of PHMSA data files that contain information on all utilities. 

Dowanload the ZIP files here: https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/gas-distribution-gas-gathering-gas-transmission-hazardous-liquids

Unzip the folder, and save. When the code is ran, input the company of interest when prompted. Once the code runs there will be an output file with all the data for that specific utility for all years of data included in the zip download. 


Using the same downloaded data, there is also an included similarity ranker.
The user can name a company, and the code will return the companies with the most similar information. This can be used to compare historical data and trends of utilities with similar operating habits and service sizes.
